        <p>My Sea Monkeys are doing well. They are low maintenance but you have to follow instructions just right. I am enjoying having them on my desk at work. They live, die, eat and mate right on my desk.  <br> -A Guilbalt, Phoenix AZ</p>

        <p>I had one of these as a young boy and loved it. I saw this reissue and just had to buy one for my boy. We are having the absolute time of our lives, making jumps and doing stunts. This toy is great, super and fantastic, all rolled into a fiery loop of pure, spectacular joy. If you are a young boy or a middle aged man and don't have one, then you are missing out. Get one!!! <br> -Mikey Chook, Buford WY</p>

        <p>I genuinely thought I was getting a sweet little shrimp-like creature for my grandson. Came in the mail... little plastic bin and a small pouch full of rice-like junk. Pour it in the water. Wait 2 days... AND IT'S ACTUAL DAMN MONKEYS ALL UP IN MY HOUSE.<br>  -Dolores Smith, Boca Raton FL</p>

        <p>My uncle was so excited to finally see my sister's reaction when she ripped off the Happy Birthday wrapping paper. Unfortunately, that reaction was irrepressible panic. She screamed, she cried, she hid under a table. Eventually I inherited the thing, and we were pals while it was light outside. As soon as the sun went down though, you can bet Teddy was shackled to a table in the playroom. <br>-Patty Mayonnaise, Bloatsburg VA</p>
