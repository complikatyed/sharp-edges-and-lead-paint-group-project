  <p class="para">Remember the good ol' days when toys were made out of poison-painted metal with life-like sharp edges?  Ahhh the glory days before "safety" officials and weak parents decided that their children were too dumb to play with their toys without wearing helmets and knee pads.  Nowadays all our kids get are cheap plastic toys that can't withstand anything more than sitting on a shelf from which the child can look at them and dream about what it would be like to play with them.  Our toys could withstand (and probably have already) a blowtorch to the robotic face before taking a ride on an oversized bottle rocket and landing without a scratch.  Our vintage toys hark back to the days before child-seats in cars and safety belts, before even toys had to be made "child-proof"....their for the children!  Why would you child-proof a toy?!  Safety, shmaftey.  

  If you don't see an item that's in stock, shoot us an e-mail and we will track down that vintage toy that you so absolutely deserve and need!  Our sales staff will respond just as soon as they get done taking their kids to the ER after they have had some real fun playing with our products.</p>
